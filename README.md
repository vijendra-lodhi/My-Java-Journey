# My Java Journey 🚀

### 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a Python learner previously now diving deep into **Java** to strengthen my understanding of core Data Structure concepts. 

I believe that learning a strictly-typed language like Java is the best way to master **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and **Object-Oriented Design**.

### 🎯 My Current Goal
**"From High-Level Magic to Low-Level Logic"**
My mission is to rebuild my knowledge base from the ground up:
1.  **Master Java Syntax & OOP:** Understanding the 'how' and 'why' of code structure.
2.  **Conquer DSA:** Implementing complex algorithms manually to understand time & space complexity.
3.  **Return to Python:** Applying these rigorous engineering principles back to Python for advanced development and cybersecurity.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
* **Languages:** Python 🐍, Java ☕
* **Tools:** VS Code, Git/GitHub
* **Focus:** Data Structures, Algorithms, System Design
